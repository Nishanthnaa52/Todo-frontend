# Todo React Frontend Setup

This document provides instructions to set up and run the Todo React frontend application using npm package manager.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nishanthnaa52/Todo-fontend.git
    cd TodoReactDjango/Todo-frontend
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Development Server**

    To start the development server, run:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the application and you can view it in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

To create a production build of the application, run:
